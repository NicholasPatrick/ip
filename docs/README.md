# User Guide

## Features

### Task List

You can keep track of your tasks, whether that would be todos, deadlines, or
events!

### Automatic Help

If you don't know how to use a command, writing that command by itself will
give you a brief explanation of its usage (except for list and sort).

### Marking Tasks

You can mark tasks as done or not done, which makes keeping track of your todos
and deadlines easier. You can also mark an event as done or not done, but I
don't know why you would ever want to do that.

## Usage

### `list` - Lists your tasks

The command will simply list all your tasks (todos, deadlines, and events).

Example of usage:
